# about me
first-paragraph: I am a graduate research assistant at the <hightlight>Smart Grid Lab under Center for Energy Systems Research (CESR)</hightlight> affiliated with the <a href="https://www.tntech.edu/engineering/programs/ece/graduate-courses.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tennsee Tech University at Cookeville, TN</a> under the guidance of <a href="https://www.tntech.edu/engineering/research/cesr/contact-us.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr. Satish Mahajan</a>, building upon the research I initiated during my initial days here. (‚óï‚ñø‚óï)
second-paragraph: I grew up in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manikganj" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Manikganj, Bangladesh</a>, and was fortunate to spend my most memorable time at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VNU-HCM_High_School_for_the_Gifted" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Batila High School for the Gifted</a> (informatics program of 2020) and previously <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tr%E1%BA%A7n_%C4%90%E1%BA%A1i_Ngh%C4%A9a_High_School_for_the_Gifted" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TƒêN Secondary School for the Gifted</a> (mathematics program of 2017) with very good friends - too many to name them here, where we played football (soccer) on concrete fields together afterschool.
research-introduction: I do research in microgrid intelligent energy management in hardware-in-the-loop environment, mainly concentrating on applying <code>machine learning and metaheuristic</code>based algorithms for determining optimal condition for economic operation of generators and load dispatch efficiently. Utilizing the real-time hardware-in-the-loop simulation by using Typhoon HIL, SEL 3530-4 RTAC and EPC inverters power controllers. 

research-interests:

  - field: Intelligent Energy Management in Grids
    subfields: smart grid, microgrid, hardware-in-the-loop simulation
  
  - field: Machine Learning and Deep Learning in Power Systems
    subfields: forecasting of solar irradiance, and load profiles
