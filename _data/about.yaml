# about me
first-paragraph: I am a graduate research assistant at the <hightlight>Smart Grid Lab under Center for Energy Systems Research (CESR)</hightlight> affiliated with the <a href="https://www.tntech.edu/engineering/programs/ece/graduate-courses.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tennsee Tech University at Cookeville, TN</a> under the guidance of <a href="https://www.tntech.edu/engineering/research/cesr/contact-us.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr. Satish Mahajan</a>. 
second-paragraph: I grew up in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manikganj" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Manikganj, Bangladesh</a>, and was fortunate to spend my most memorable time at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pabna University of Science and Technology</a> (electrical and computer engineering program from 2009-2013) with very good friends, where we learned a lot of technical aspects and also played Cricket, football (soccer) on University fields together.
research-introduction: I do research in microgrid intelligent energy management, mainly concentrating on <code>machine learning and metaheuristic</code>based algorithms for determining the optimal operation of DERs and dispatch of load efficiently. Utilizing the real-time HIL simulation of Typhoon HIL, SEL 3530-4 RTAC, and EPC inverters power controllers. 

research-interests:

  - field: Intelligent Energy Management in Grids
    subfields: smart grid, microgrid, hardware-in-the-loop simulation
  
  - field: Machine Learning and Deep Learning in Power Systems
    subfields: forecasting of solar irradiance, and load profiles
