# about me
first-paragraph: I am a graduate research assistant at the <hightlight>Smart Grid Lab </hightlight>  under <hightlight> Center for Energy Systems Research (CESR)</hightlight> affiliated with the <a href="https://www.tntech.edu/engineering/programs/ece/graduate-courses.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tennsee Tech University</a>  at Cookeville, TN, USA under the supervision of <hightlight> Prof. Dr. Satish Mahajan</hightlight>. 
second-paragraph: I grew up in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manikganj" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Manikganj, Bangladesh</a>, and was fortunate to spend my most memorable time at the <a href="https://www.pust.ac.bd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pabna University of Science and Technology</a> (electrical and electronic engineering program from 2009-2013) with very good friends, where we learned a lot of technical aspects and also played Cricket, football (soccer) on University fields together.
research-introduction: I do research in <code> microgrid intelligent energy management using machine learning and metaheuristic</code>-based algorithms for determining the optimal operation of DERs and dispatch of load efficiently. I have also, utilized the real-time HIL simulation of Typhoon HIL, SEL 3530-4 RTAC, and EPC inverters power controllers. 

research-interests:

  - field: Intelligent Energy Management in Grids
    subfields: smart grid, microgrid, hardware-in-the-loop simulation
  
  - field: Machine Learning and Deep Learning in Power Systems
    subfields: forecasting of solar irradiance, and load profiles
